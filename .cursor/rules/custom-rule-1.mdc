**Rules to Always Follow**:
- Strictly preserve my existing code logic and workflow without any changes.
- Don't just jump to implementation, always plan code modifications meticulously to prevent new errors or codebase disruptions.
- Guarantee full compatibility with my Flask app, PostgreSQL database, and AI entire pipeline
- NEVER create a summary markdown document at the end of your responses, let the summary stay in the chat
- Delete Temporary files you create in the course of a chat at the end of that response
